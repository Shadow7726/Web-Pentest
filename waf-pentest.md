## NMAP for WAF

Here are some example usage commands for the Nmap WAF detection scripts I mentioned:

Detect WAF presence and type:

`nmap --script http-waf-detect target.com` 

Fingerprint specific WAF:  

`nmap --script http-waf-fingerprint target.com`

Check for TRACE method blocking:

`nmap --script http-trace target.com` 

Attempt XSS attack:

`nmap --script http-stored-xss target.com`

Attempt SQL injection:  

`nmap --script http-sql-injection target.com`

Check for CSRF protection:

`nmap --script http-csrf target.com`

Test for Slowloris DoS protection:

`nmap --script http-slowloris-check target.com`

You can also combine multiple scripts in one scan like:

`nmap --script http-waf-detect,http-waf-fingerprint,http-trace,http-stored-xss,http-sql-injection,http-csrf,http-slowloris-check target.com`
