# Validating SSL/TLS Implementation

There are several techniques that can be used to validate proper SSL/TLS implementation on web applications and other TCP services. Common methods include:

## Active Scanning

- Use [nmap](https://nmap.org/) to perform port scans and enumerate supported ciphers:

    ```bash
    nmap -p 443 --script ssl-enum-ciphers <host>
    ```

- Utilize the [testssl.sh](https://testssl.sh/) script to test handshakes and output configuration details:

    ```bash 
    testssl.sh <hostname>
    ```

- Use [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/) s_client for certificate inspection and connection testing:

    ```bash
    openssl s_client -connect <host:port>
    ```

## Header and Certificate Inspection 

- Check for SSL certificates and chains in HTTP response headers.

- Verify HTTPS protocol usage in request URLs. 

- Inspect certificates visually via browser clicks and developer tools.

## Traffic and Resource Validation

- Confirm encryption on web resources loaded from server. 

- Examine browser developer console for HTTPS requests.

- Use network traffic capture and analysis tools like Wireshark.

## Automated Scanning Tools

- Services like [sslscan](https://github.com/rbsec/sslscan) and [testssl.sh](https://testssl.sh/) provide automated testing and output of SSL/TLS configuration.

- Web vulnerability scanners often detect incorrect SSL implementation.

Proper validation typically requires a combination of methods including active connection testing, traffic and certificate inspection, and configuration scanning tools. This provides comprehensive validation of both frontend and backend SSL/TLS usage.
